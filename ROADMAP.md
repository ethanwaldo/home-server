# Home Server Roadmap
*Tracking progress on my Raspberry Pi gateway + Windows desktop AI backend*

## Phase 1 â€” Core Infrastructure (âœ… Complete)

### Raspberry Pi Gateway Setup
- [x] Ubuntu Server LTS with SSH hardening (key-only auth)
- [x] UFW + Fail2Ban security hardening
- [x] Docker + Docker Compose environment
- [x] `log2ram` + `unattended-upgrades` for reliability

### Networking & Domain
- [x] Domain registration (`ethanwaldo.dev`)
- [x] DDNS configuration with Porkbun API via `ddclient`
- [x] Headscale (self-hosted Tailscale) VPN mesh network
- [x] Caddy v2 reverse proxy with auto-HTTPS

### Service Architecture
- [x] Docker Compose orchestration for all Pi services
- [x] VPN-only access model (no public admin interfaces)
- [x] Portfolio website hosting at `https://ethanwaldo.dev`

## Architecture Principles

- **VPN-First:** All management over secure overlay network
- **Minimal Surface:** Pi runs only essential gateway services
- **Developer-Focused:** Optimize for coding workflow efficiency
- **Resource Efficient:** Desktop powers down when not needed
- **Security Hardened:** Defense in depth, least privilege access
